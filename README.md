# Conway's "Game of Life"

Welcome to John Conway's "Game of Life"! This is a computer science classic from 1970, a program that simulates a cellular automaton (plural automata). It has connections to all kinds of different aspects of computer science and nature.

# Rules:

Each generation, or turn, in the game the following rules are applied:

1. Any dead cell with exactly three neighbours becomes alive
2. Any live cell with more than 3 or less than 2 neighbours dies, due to overcrowding or loneliness respectively.
