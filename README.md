# Conway's "Game of Life"

Welcome to John Conway's "Game of Life"! This is a computer science classic from 1970, a program that simulates a cellular automaton (plural automata). It has connections to all kinds of different aspects of computer science and nature.

# Rules:

Each generation, or turn, in the game the following rules are applied:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
